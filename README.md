This project demonstrates the design and simulation of an **autonomous maze-following robot** implemented in the **Webots simulation environment**.  
The robot combines **PID control** with **graph-based search algorithms (BFS and DFS)** to explore and solve maze structures intelligently.  
The control logic and algorithms were developed in **Python**, integrating motion control with real-time decision-making for stable and efficient navigation.

## üìò Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to create a robot capable of autonomously exploring and navigating through a maze.  
Using **PID feedback control**, the robot maintains stable motion and precise turns, while **BFS** and **DFS** algorithms are used for **pathfinding** and **exploration**.

The entire system was modeled and tested in **Webots**, where we simulated both the robot‚Äôs kinematics and its decision-making process under realistic conditions.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Features

- **PID Control for Motion Stability:**  
  A discrete-time PID controller regulates the robot‚Äôs wheel speeds and orientation, ensuring smooth and accurate movements.

- **BFS & DFS Path Planning:**  
  Implemented Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithms for intelligent maze traversal and route generation.

- **Webots Simulation:**  
  The complete robot model, environment, and control loop were built and tested in Webots for realistic visualization and debugging.

- **Autonomous Navigation:**  
  The robot combines control and logic layers, making local and global navigation decisions without human intervention.
