This project presents the design and implementation of an **autonomous maze-following robot** that combines **PID control** with **search algorithms (BFS and DFS)** for intelligent path planning and navigation.  
The system was implemented in Python and MATLAB, integrating control theory with algorithmic decision-making to achieve stable and efficient movement through a maze.

## üìò Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a robot capable of exploring and solving a maze using both **feedback control** and **graph-based search algorithms**.  
The robot uses a **PID controller** for real-time motion correction and a **BFS/DFS-based path planner** to determine the optimal or complete traversal path.

The system was tested in a simulated environment, combining control dynamics and logical pathfinding for smooth and efficient navigation.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Features

- **PID Control for Motion Stability:**  
  A discrete-time PID controller ensures smooth speed and heading control, correcting errors in real time.

- **BFS & DFS Path Planning:**  
  Implemented Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithms for maze exploration and optimal route generation.

- **Autonomous Navigation:**  
  The robot makes local and global navigation decisions based on environmental feedback and precomputed paths.

- **Simulation and Analysis:**  
  Full simulation and control loop validation were performed in Python and MATLAB.

## üìä Simulation and Results

The robot successfully navigated multiple maze layouts using a combination of control and search strategies.  
PID control maintained stable motion, while BFS and DFS efficiently mapped and solved the maze.

Key observations:
- Smooth and stable motion under digital control.  
- Successful maze solving using BFS and DFS.  
- Robust performance under turns, dead-ends, and path changes.
